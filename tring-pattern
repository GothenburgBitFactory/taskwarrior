# Revsets

Jujutsu supports a functional language for selecting a set of revisions.
Expressions in this language are called "revsets" (the idea comes from
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/help/revsets)). The language
consists of symbols, operators, and functions.

Most `jj` commands accept a revset (or multiple). Many commands, such as
`jj edit <revset>` expect the revset to resolve to a single commit; it is an
error to pass a revset that resolves to more than one commit (or zero commits)
to such commands.

The words "revisions" and "commits" are used interchangeably in this document.

## Hidden revisions

Most revsets search only the [visible commits](glossary.md#visible-commits).
Other commits are only included if you explicitly mention them (e.g. by commit
ID, `<name>@<remote>` symbol, or `at_operation()` function).

If hidden commits are specified, their ancestors also become available to the
search space. They are included in `all()`, `x..`, `~x`, etc., but not in
`..visible_heads()`, etc. For example, `hidden_id | all()` is equivalent to
`hidden_id | ::(hidden_id | visible_heads())`.

## Symbols

The `@` expression refers to the working copy commit in the current workspace.
Use `<workspace name>@` to refer to the working-copy commit in another
workspace. Use `<name>@<remote>` to refer to a remote-tracking bookmark.

A full commit ID refers to a single commit. A unique prefix of the full commit
ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique prefix.

A full change ID refers to a visible commit with that change ID. A unique prefix
of the full change ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique
prefix or [a divergent change ID][divergent-change].

Use [single or double quotes][string-literals] to prevent a symbol from being
interpreted as an expression. For example, `"x-"` is the symbol `x-`, not the
parents of symbol `x`. Taking shell quoting into account, you may need to use
something like `jj log -r '"x-"'`.

[string-literals]: templates.md#string-literals

### Priority

Jujutsu attempts to resolve a symbol in the following order:

1. Tag name
2. Bookmark name
3. Git ref
4. Commit ID or change ID

To override the priority, use the appropriate [revset function](#functions). For
example, to resolve `abc` as a commit ID even if there happens to be a bookmark
by the same name, use `commit_id(abc)`. This is particularly useful in scripts.

## Operators

The following operators are supported. `x` and `y` below can be any revset, not
only symbols.

* `x-`: Parents of `x`, can be empty.
* `x+`: Children of `x`, can be empty.
* `x::`: Descendants of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Equivalent to
  `x::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.
* `x..`: Revisions that are not ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to `~::x`, and
  `x..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.
* `::x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Shorthand for
  `root()::x`.
* `..x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself, but excluding
  the root commit. Shorthand for `root()..x`. Equivalent to `::x ~ root()`.
* `x::y`: Descendants of `x` that are also ancestors of `y`. Equivalent
   to `x:: & ::y`. This is what `git log` calls `--ancestry-path x..y`.
* `x..y`: Ancestors of `y` that are not also ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to
  `::y ~ ::x`. This is what `git log` calls `x..y` (i.e. the same as we call it).
* `::`: All visible commits in the repo. Equivalent to `all()`, and
  `root()::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.
* `..`: All visible commits in the repo, but excluding the root commit.
  Equivalent to `~root()`, and `root()..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions
  are mentioned.
* `~x`: Revisions that are not in `x`.
* `x & y`: Revisions that are in both `x` and `y`.
* `x ~ y`: Revisions that are in `x` but not in `y`.
* `x | y`: Revisions that are in either `x` or `y` (or both).

(listed in order of binding strengths)

You can use parentheses to control evaluation order, such as `(x & y) | z` or
`x & (y | z)`.

## Functions

You can also specify revisions by using functions. Some functions take other
revsets (expressions) as arguments.

??? note "Function argument syntax"

    In this documentation, optional arguments are indicated with square
    brackets like `[arg]`. Some arguments also have an optional label which can
    be used to specify that argument without specifying all previous arguments.

    For instance, `remote_bookmarks([bookmark_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`
    indicates that all of the following usages are valid:

    * `remote_bookmarks()`
    * `remote_bookmarks("main")`
    * `remote_bookmarks("main", "origin")`
    * `remote_bookmarks("main", remote="origin")`
    * `remote_bookmarks(remote="origin")`

* `parents(x, [depth])`: `parents(x)` is the same as `x-`.
  `parents(x, depth)` returns the parents of `x` at the given `depth`. For
  instance, `parents(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x---`.

* `children(x, [depth])`: `children(x)` is the same as `x+`.
  `children(x, depth)` returns the children of `x` at the given `depth`. For
  instance, `children(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x+++`.

* `ancestors(x, [depth])`: `ancestors(x)` is the same as `::x`.
  `ancestors(x, depth)` returns the ancestors of `x` limited to the given
  `depth`.

* `descendants(x, [depth])`: `descendants(x)` is the same as `x::`.
  `descendants(x, depth)` returns the descendants of `x` limited to the given
  `depth`.

* `first_parent(x, [depth])`: `first_parent(x)` is similar to `parents(x)`, but
  for merges, it only returns the first parent instead of returning all parents.
  The `depth` argument also works similarly, so `first_parent(x, 2)` is
  equivalent to `first_parent(first_parent(x))`.

* `first_ancestors(x, [depth])`: Similar to `ancestors(x, [depth])`, but only
  traverses the first parent of each commit. In Git, the first parent of a merge
  commit is conventionally the branch into which changes are being merged, so
  `first_ancestors()` can be used to exclude changes made on other branches.

* `reachable(srcs, domain)`: All commits reachable from `srcs` within
  `domain`, traversing all parent and child edges.

* `connected(x)`: Same as `x::x`. Useful when `x` includes several commits.

* `all()`: All visible commits and ancestors of commits explicitly mentioned.

* `none()`: No commits. This function is rarely useful; it is provided for
  completeness.

* `change_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given change ID prefix. If the specified
  change is divergent, this resolves to multiple commits. It is an error to use a
  non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.

* `commit_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given commit ID prefix. It is an error
  to use a non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.

* `bookmarks([pattern])`: All local bookmark targets. If `pattern` is specified,
  this selects the bookmarks whose name match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns). For example, `bookmarks(push)` would match the
  bookmarks `push-123` and `repushed` but not the bookmark `main`. If a bookmark is
  in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

* `remote_bookmarks([bookmark_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All remote
  bookmarks targets across all remotes. If just the `bookmark_pattern` is
  specified, the bookmarks whose names match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns) across all remotes are selected. If both
  `bookmark_pattern` and `remote_pattern` are specified, the selection is
  further restricted to just the remotes whose names match `remote_pattern`.

  For example, `remote_bookmarks(push, ri)` would match the bookmarks
  `push-123@origin` and `repushed@private` but not `push-123@upstream` or
  `main@origin` or `main@upstream`. If a bookmark is in a conflicted state, all
  its possible targets are included.

  While Git-tracking bookmarks can be selected by `<name>@git`, these bookmarks
  aren't included in `remote_bookmarks()`.

* `tracked_remote_bookmarks([bookmark_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All
  targets of tracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments as
  `remote_bookmarks()`.

* `untracked_remote_bookmarks([bookmark_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`:
  All targets of untracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments
  as `remote_bookmarks()`.

* `tags([pattern])`: All tag targets. If `pattern` is specified,
  this selects the tags whose name match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns). For example, `tags(v1)` would match the
  tags `v123` and `rev1` but not the tag `v2`. If a tag is
  in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

* `git_refs()`:  All Git ref targets as of the last import. If a Git ref
  is in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

* `git_head()`: The Git `HEAD` target as of the last import.

* `visible_heads()`: All visible heads (same as `heads(all())` if no hidden
  revisions are mentioned).

* `root()`: The virtual commit that is the oldest ancestor of all other commits.

* `heads(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not ancestors of other commits in `x`.
  Equivalent to `x ~ ::x-`. Note that this is different from
  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `heads(x)`
  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x-`.

* `roots(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not descendants of other commits in `x`.
  Equivalent to `x ~ x+::`. Note that this is different from
  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `roots(x)`
  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x+`.

* `latest(x, [count])`: Latest `count` commits in `x`, based on committer
  timestamp. The default `count` is 1.

* `fork_point(x)`: The fork point of all commits in `x`. The fork point is the
  common ancestor(s) of all commits in `x` which do not have any descendants
  that are also common ancestors of all commits in `x`. It is equivalent to
  the revset `heads(::x_1 & ::x_2 & ... & ::x_N)`, where `x_{1..N}` are commits
  in `x`. If `x` resolves to a single commit, `fork_point(x)` resolves to `x`.

* `bisect(x)`: Finds commits in the input set for which about half of the input
  set are descendants. The current implementation deals somewhat poorly with
  non-linear history.

* `exactly(x, count)`: Evaluates `x`, and errors if it is not of exactly size
  `count`. Otherwise, returns `x`. This is useful in particular with `count=1`
  when you want to ensure that some revset expression has exactly one target.

* `merges()`: Merge commits.

* `description(pattern)`: Commits that have a description matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

  A non-empty description is usually terminated with newline character. For
  example, `description(exact:"")` matches commits without description, and
  `description(exact:"foo\n")` matches commits with description `"foo\n"`.

* `subject(pattern)`: Commits that have a subject matching the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns). A subject is the first line of the description
  (without newline character.)

* `author(pattern)`: Commits with the author's name or email matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns). Equivalent to `author_name(pattern) |
  author_email(pattern)`.

* `author_name(pattern)`: Commits with the author's name matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `author_email(pattern)`: Commits with the author's email matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `author_date(pattern)`: Commits with author dates matching the specified [date
  pattern](#date-patterns).

* `mine()`: Commits where the author's email matches the email of the current
  user. Equivalent to `author_email(exact-i:<user-email>)`

* `committer(pattern)`: Commits with the committer's name or email matching the
  given [string pattern](#string-patterns). Equivalent to
  `committer_name(pattern) | committer_email(pattern)`.

* `committer_name(pattern)`: Commits with the committer's name matching the
  given [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `committer_email(pattern)`: Commits with the committer's email matching the
  given [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `committer_date(pattern)`: Commits with committer dates matching the specified
  [date pattern](#date-patterns).

* `signed()`: Commits that are cryptographically signed.

* `empty()`: Commits modifying no files. This also includes `merges()` without
  user modifications and `root()`.

* `files(expression)`: Commits modifying paths matching the given [fileset
  expression](filesets.md).

  Paths are relative to the directory `jj` was invoked from. A directory name
  will match all files in that directory and its subdirectories.

  For example, `files(foo)` will match files `foo`, `foo/bar`, `foo/bar/baz`.
  It will *not* match `foobar` or `bar/foo`.

  Some file patterns might need quoting because the `expression` must also be
  parsable as a revset. For example, `.` has to be quoted in `files(".")`.

* `diff_contains(text, [files])`: Commits containing diffs matching the given
  `text` pattern line by line.

  The search paths can be narrowed by the `files` expression. All modified files
  are scanned by default, but it is likely to change in future version to
  respect the command line path arguments.

  For example, `diff_contains("TODO", "src")` will search revisions where "TODO"
  is added to or removed from files under "src".

* `conflicts()`: Commits with conflicts.

* `present(x)`: Same as `x`, but evaluated to `none()` if any of the commits
  in `x` doesn't exist (e.g. is an unknown bookmark name.)

* `coalesce(revsets...)`: Commits in the first revset in the list of `revsets`
  which does not evaluate to `none()`. If all revsets evaluate to `none()`, then
  the result of `coalesce` will also be `none()`.

* `working_copies()`: The working copy commits across all the workspaces.

* `at_operation(op, x)`: Evaluates `x` at the specified [operation][]. For
  example, `at_operation(@-, visible_heads())` will return all heads which were
  visible at the previous operation.

  Since `at_operation(op, x)` brings all commits that were visible at the
  operation to the search space, `at_operation(op, x) | all()` is equivalent to
  `at_operation(op, x) | ::(at_operation(op, x | visible_heads()) |
  visible_heads())`.

## String patterns

Functions that perform string matching support the following pattern syntax (the
quotes are optional):

* `"string"` or `substring:"string"`: Matches strings that contain `string`.
* `exact:"string"`: Matches strings exactly equal to `string`.
* `glob:"pattern"`: Matches strings with Unix-style shell [wildcard
  `pattern`](https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/#syntax).
* `regex:"pattern"`: Matches substrings with [regular
  expression `pattern`](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).

You can append `-i` after the kind to match case‐insensitively (e.g.
`glob-i:"fix*jpeg*"`).

## Date patterns

Functions that perform date matching support the following pattern syntax:

* `after:"string"`: Matches dates exactly at or after the given date.
* `before:"string"`: Matches dates before, but not including, the given date.

Date strings can be specified in several forms, including:

* 2024-02-01
* 2024-02-01T12:00:00
* 2024-02-01T12:00:00-08:00
* 2024-02-01 12:00:00
* 2 days ago
* 5 minutes ago
* yesterday
* yesterday 5pm
* yesterday 10:30
* yesterday 15:30

## Aliases

New symbols and functions can be defined in the config file, by using any
combination of the predefined symbols/functions and other aliases.

Alias functions can be overloaded by the number of parameters. However, builtin
function will be shadowed by name, and can't co-exist with aliases.

For example:

```toml
[revset-aliases]
'HEAD' = '@-'
'user()' = 'user("me@example.org")'
'user(x)' = 'author(x) | committer(x)'
```

### Built-in Aliases

The following aliases are built-in and used for certain operations. These functions
are defined as aliases in order to allow you to overwrite them as needed.
See [revsets.toml](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/cli/src/config/revsets.toml)
for a comprehensive list.

* `trunk()`: Resolves to the head commit for the default bookmark of the default
  remote, or the remote named `upstream` or `origin`. This is set at the
  repository level upon initialization of a Jujutsu repository.

  If the default bookmark cannot be resolved during initialization, the default
  global configuration tries the bookmarks `main`, `master`, and `trunk` on the
  `upstream` and `origin` remotes. If more than one potential trunk commit
  exists, the newest one is chosen. If none of the bookmarks exist, the revset
  evaluates to `root()`.

  You can [override](./config.md) this as appropriate. If you do, make sure it
  always resolves to exactly one commit. For example:

  ```toml
  [revset-aliases]
  'trunk()' = 'your-bookmark@your-remote'
  ```

* `builtin_immutable_heads()`: Resolves to
  `present(trunk()) | tags() | untracked_remote_bookmarks()`. It is used as the
   default definition for `immutable_heads()` below. It is not recommended to
   redefine this alias. Prefer to redefine `immutable_heads()` instead.

* `immutable_heads()`: Resolves to
  `present(trunk()) | tags() | untracked_remote_bookmarks()` by default. It is
  actually defined as `builtin_immutable_heads()`, and can be overridden as
  required. See [here](config.md#set-of-immutable-commits) for details.

* `immutable()`: The set of commits that `jj` treats as immutable. This is
  equivalent to `::(immutable_heads() | root())`. It is not recommended to redefine
  this alias. Note that modifying this will *not* change whether a commit is immutable.
  To do that, edit `immutable_heads()`.

* `mutable()`: The set of commits that `jj` treats as mutable. This is
  equivalent to `~immutable()`. It is not recommended to redefined this alias.
  Note that modifying this will *not* change whether a commit is immutable.
  To do that, edit `immutable_heads()`.


## The `all:` modifier

Certain commands (such as `jj rebase`) can take multiple revset arguments, and
each of these may resolve to one-or-many revisions.

If you set the `ui.always-allow-large-revsets` option to `false`, `jj` will not
allow revsets that resolve to more than one revision &mdash; a so-called "large
revset" &mdash; and will ask you to confirm that you want to proceed by
prefixing it with the `all:` modifier. *This option is planned to be removed.*

An `all:` modifier before a revset expression does not otherwise change its
meaning. Strictly speaking, it is not part of the revset language. The notation
is similar to the modifiers like `glob:` allowed before [string
patterns](#string-patterns).

For example, `jj rebase -r w -d xyz+` will rebase `w` on top of the child of
`xyz` as long as `xyz` has exactly one child.

If `xyz` has more than one child, the `all:` modifier is *not* specified, and
`ui.always-allow-large-revsets` is `false`, `jj rebase -r w -d xyz+` will return
an error.

If `ui.always-allow-large-revsets` was `true` (the default), the above command
would act as if `all:` was set (see the next paragraph).

With the `all:` modifier, `jj rebase -r w -d all:xyz+` will make `w` into a merge
commit if `xyz` has more than one child. The `all:` modifier confirms that the
user expected `xyz` to have more than one child.

A more useful example: if `w` is a merge commit, `jj rebase -s w -d all:w- -d
xyz` will add `xyz` to the list of `w`'s parents.

## Examples

Show the parent(s) of the working-copy commit (like `git log -1 HEAD`):

```shell
jj log -r @-
```

Show all ancestors of the working copy (like plain `git log`)

```shell
jj log -r ::@
```

Show commits not on any remote bookmark:

```shell
jj log -r 'remote_bookmarks()..'
```

Show commits not on `origin` (if you have other remotes like `fork`):

```shell
jj log -r 'remote_bookmarks(remote=origin)..'
```

Show the initial commits in the repo (the ones Git calls "root commits"):

```shell
jj log -r 'root()+'
```

Show some important commits (like `git --simplify-by-decoration`):

```shell
jj log -r 'tags() | bookmarks()'
```

Show local commits leading up to the working copy, as well as descendants of
those commits:


```shell
jj log -r '(remote_bookmarks()..@)::'
```

Show commits authored by "martinvonz" and containing the word "reset" in the
description:

```shell
jj log -r 'author(martinvonz) & description(reset)'
```

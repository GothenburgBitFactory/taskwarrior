Test Namer

The utility functions in this directory were intended for one-time use: to rename test files according to their language.
Originally, the python and bash test files had the form test.t.

- `namer.py` was used to rename these test files according to the convention already being used for the cpp tests:
    test.t  --> test.t.sh  (shell files)
    test.t  --> test.t.py  (python files)

- `first_lines.py` was used as an aid to identify the types of files in the test directory.

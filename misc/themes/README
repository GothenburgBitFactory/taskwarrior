Themes

These scripts are a way to generate a little sample data, and show the color
themes.  It is not intended for general use.

To generate samples of themes, first execute the 'setup' script to generate the
sample data.  Note that this data may need to be tweaked to include qualities
that need to be illustrated in theme sample.

Using a dark-background terminal (black recommended), run the following:

  run.dark

Using a light-background terminal, run the following:

  run.light

Using a solarized dark terminal, run the following:

  run.solar.dark

Using a solarized light terminal, run the following:

  run.solar.light

Note that for the solarized themes, the terminal color palette needs to be set
to specific colors.

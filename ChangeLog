- Task now supports nested .taskrc files using the "include /path" directive.
- The 'entry', 'start' and 'end' columns now have equivalents that include the
  time, and are called 'entry_time', 'start_time', and 'end_time', for use in
  custom reports.
- 2 new columns have been added to the reports: countdown and
  countdown_compact.  They show the days left until a task is due or how many
  days a task has been overdue.
- The new 'priority_long' field can be shown in custom reports, and will
  display 'High' rather than the abbreviated 'H'.
- Task now supports .taskrc command line overrides using rc.name:value and
  the new rc.name=value to accommodate a frequent mistake.
- The color rules for projects (color.project.foo) now matches on partial
  project names, the same way as filters.
- The color command now takes a color as an argument, and displays that color
  with sample text.
- Added 2 new configuration variables to display the details of tasks with due
  dates when doing a 'task cal' for the corresponding months:
  'calendar.details' and 'calendar.details.report'
- Added 5 new color configuration variables to colorize today, days with due
  tasks, days with overdue tasks, weekend days and week numbers in the
  calendar:
  'calendar.color.today', 'color.calendar.due', 'calendar.calendar.overdue',
  'color.calendar.weekend'and 'color.calendar.weeknumber'.
- Added support for holidays in the calendar by using calendar.holidays
  and the corresponding holiday.X.name and holiday.X.date variables.
  The default dateformat being YMD (20101224) set by dateformat.holiday.
- The coloring of due tasks in reports can now be enabled for all tasks, and
  not only the imminent ones, by setting the configuration variable due=0.

  keyword searches and substitutions (thanks to John Florian).
- Task can now use an alternate tag indicator by setting the tag.indicator
  configuration variable to something other than the default of +.
- Task can now use an alternate active indicator by setting the
  active.indicator configuration variable to something other than the default
  of *.
- Task can now use an alternate recurrence indicator by setting the
  recurrence.indicator configuration variable to something other than the
  default of R.
- Added a new file, README.build, which provides assistance troubleshooting
  build-related problems on different operating systems and environments.
- Fixed bug #316 which caused the timesheet report to display an oddly sorted
  list.
- Fixed bug #317 which colored tasks in the 'completed' report according to
  due dates, which are no longer relevant to a completed task (thanks to
  Cory Donnelly).
- Fixed bug #347 which used only a lowercase "all" to confirm multiple changes
  instead of an uppercase "All" like the "Yes" answer.
- Fixed bug that was causing the 'completed' report to sort incorrectly.
- Fixed bug that showed a calendar for the year 2037 when 'task calendar due'
  was run, and there are no tasks with due dates.
- Fixed bug #360 which prevented certain modifications to recurring tasks
  (thanks to John Florian).
- Fixed bug #299 which prevented excluding multiple projects from a report,
  by using "task list project.isnt:foo project.isnt:bar" (thanks to John
  Florian).
- Fixed bug #368 which caused recurring tasks 'until' dates to be rendered as
  epoch numbers instead of dates (thanks to Cory Donnelly).
- Fixed bug #369 which prevented the config command from setting quoted or
  unquoted multi-word values (thanks to Richard Querin).
- Fixed bug #370 which prevented the removal of a due date from a task,
  mis-identifying the task as recurring just because it had a due date
  (thanks to John Florian).
- Fixed bug #371 which caused task to mis-apply certain color rules, like
  color.alternate, which was (a) not applied first, and (b) not blended
  with the other color rules (thanks to Richard Querin).
- Fixed bug #372 which incorrectly mapped 16-color backgrounds into the
  256-color space.

  not mentioned anywhere (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
- Fixed bug #319 that caused task to not properly detect the removal of a
  tag when obtaining confirmation from the user fora bulk modification
  (thanks to Cory Donnelly).

  with a complete undo stack that can rollback all changes.
- While waiting for a file lock, task states the reason for the delay.
- Now supports a 'waiting' state that causes tasks to not appear until
  a certain date, for example "task <ID> wait:<date>".  The task
  will then not show up on any report (except 'all') until that date.

  is a set of IDs.  This allows commands like "task delete 1 2 5-10,12".
- Fixed bug in the ghistory report, which caused it to only show a new
  month if a task was added during that month.
- New command "duplicate" which allow existing task(s) to be duplicated,

  reports have been converted to user-defined reports.
- New online documentation for custom reports.
- New algorithm for determining when the "nag" message is displayed.
- Fixed bug where task hangs with a certain combination of recurring tasks
  and shadow files.

- Fixed misleading task count at bottom on "info" report.
- Added support for a shadow file that contains a plain text task report,
  with the "shadow.file" and "shadow.command" configuration variables.
  The shadow file is automatically updated whenever the task database
  changes.  Useful for integrating with "Samurize".
- Task now displays a message whenever a shadow file is updated, if the
  "shadow.notify" configuration variable is set "on".

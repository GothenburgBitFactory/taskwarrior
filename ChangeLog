  does not do {} expansion, thereby causing push/pull errors (thanks to Russell
  Steicke).

- All holiday files have been renamed to include a locale, rather than just a
  country code.  For example: holidays.en-US.rc.

  project names, the same way as filters.
- The color command now takes a color as an argument, and displays that color
  with sample text.

  dates when doing a 'task cal' for the corresponding months:
  'calendar.details' and 'calendar.details.report'

  tasks, days with overdue tasks, weekend days and week numbers in the
  calendar:
  'calendar.color.today', 'color.calendar.due', 'calendar.calendar.overdue',
  'color.calendar.weekend'and 'color.calendar.weeknumber'.

  recurrence.indicator configuration variable to something other than the
  default of R.

  build-related problems on different operating systems and environments.
- Fixed bug #316 which caused the timesheet report to display an oddly sorted
  list.
- Fixed bug #317 which colored tasks in the 'completed' report according to
  due dates, which are no longer relevant to a completed task (thanks to
  Cory Donnelly).
- Fixed bug #347 which used only a lowercase "all" to confirm multiple changes
  instead of an uppercase "All" like the "Yes" answer.
- Fixed bug that was causing the 'completed' report to sort incorrectly.

  was run, and there are no tasks with due dates.
- Fixed bug #360 which prevented certain modifications to recurring tasks
  (thanks to John Florian).
- Fixed bug #299 which prevented excluding multiple projects from a report,
  by using "task list project.isnt:foo project.isnt:bar" (thanks to John
  Florian).
- Fixed bug #368 which caused recurring tasks 'until' dates to be rendered as
  epoch numbers instead of dates (thanks to Cory Donnelly).
- Fixed bug #369 which prevented the config command from setting quoted or
  unquoted multi-word values (thanks to Richard Querin).
- Fixed bug #370 which prevented the removal of a due date from a task,
  mis-identifying the task as recurring just because it had a due date
  (thanks to John Florian).

  color.alternate, which was (a) not applied first, and (b) not blended
  with the other color rules (thanks to Richard Querin).

  part of the description, despite what they otherwise might mean.
- Removed support for the obsolete task file format 1 (never released).
- Fixed bug that allowed blank annotations to be added (thanks to Bruce
  Dillahunty).
- Supports negative tag filters, so that (task list +foo -bar) now filters
  tasks that have the "foo" tag, but do not have the "bar" tag (thanks to
  Chris Pride).
- Custom reports now support a more compact form of the "age" column,
  called "age_compact" (thanks to T. Charles Yun).

  http://taskwarrior.org will provide better information.
- Fixed bug that kept some deleted tasks showing up on the calendar report
  (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
- Now asks the user to confirm large changes if configuration variable
  'confirmation' is set to 'yes'.  A large change is one that completely
  replaces a task description, or operates on a large number of tasks,

  variable  (thanks to John Florian).
- Now echoes back the new task ID on 'add' (thanks to Bruce Dillahunty).

  printed before and after report output, with the 'color.header' and
  'color.footnote' configuration variables.
- Now supports the 'limit' attribute, to control the number of tasks that
  are shown, for example: "task list limit:10".
- Now supports a debug mode that can be used to generate helpful information
  when reporting a problem.  Just run the command with "task rc.debug:on ..."
  and diagnostics will be generated that will help pinpoint a problem.
- The new "undo" command replaces the old "undo" and "undelete" command
  with a complete undo stack that can rollback all changes.
- While waiting for a file lock, task states the reason for the delay.
- Now supports a 'waiting' state that causes tasks to not appear until
  a certain date, for example "task <ID> wait:<date>".  The task
  will then not show up on any report (except 'all') until that date.
- The "active", "completed", "overdue" and "next" reports are now custom
  reports, and therefore modifiable.

- Task allows commands that require an ID to now be given a sequence, which
  is a set of IDs.  This allows commands like "task delete 1 2 5-10,12".
- Fixed bug in the ghistory report, which caused it to only show a new
  month if a task was added during that month.
- New command "duplicate" which allow existing task(s) to be duplicated,

  (thanks to Federico Hernandez and P.C. Shyamshankar).
- Fixed bug that causes task to create a default .task directory, even if
  data.location specified otherwise (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
- New "edit" command that fires up a text editor (uses 'editor' configuration
  variable, $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variable) and allows direct
  editing of all editable task details.

  and it excludes annotations.
- A task can now be upgraded to a recurring task by adding a recurrence
  frequency, a due date, and an optional until date.
- When a recurring task is modified, all other instances of the recurring
  task are also modified.
- Custom reports now support user-specified column labels (thanks to T.
  Charles Yun).
- Task can now import tasks from a variety of data formats, including task
  export files from versions 1.4.3 and earlier, versions 1.5.0 and later,
  todo.sh 2.x, CSV, plain text and task command line.  See online docs for
  full details.
- Export was including 'id' in the column header even though it was not
  included in the data.
- The task file format has changed slightly.  Please back up your task

  has any tags.  This column can be added to any custom report.
- Fixed bug where sometimes a task description was concatenated oddly if

  reports have been converted to user-defined reports.
- New online documentation for custom reports.
- New algorithm for determining when the "nag" message is displayed.

- Fixed misleading task count at bottom on "info" report.
- Added support for a shadow file that contains a plain text task report,
  with the "shadow.file" and "shadow.command" configuration variables.
  The shadow file is automatically updated whenever the task database
  changes.  Useful for integrating with "Samurize".
- Task now displays a message whenever a shadow file is updated, if the
  "shadow.notify" configuration variable is set "on".
- Bug: adding a task with a \n, \r or \f in it now fails properly.
- Removed "usage" command, and support for "command.logging" configuration
  variable.
- Added documentation for Shadow files.
- Added documentation for task filters.

  task list due:tomorrow, task list due:23rd ...).
- Bug: Source now properly includes <string.h> in order to build clean
  using gcc 4.3 (thanks to H. İbrahim Güngör).

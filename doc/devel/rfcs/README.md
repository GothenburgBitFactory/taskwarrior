# Taskwarrior RFCS

In the mid-2010's, Taskwarrior development was organized around RFCs, as a way to invite comment before designs were finalized.
Although these documents were less formal than [IETF RFCs](https://www.ietf.org/rfc) they serve a similar purpose.
In more recent years, use of RFCs has been discontinued, and the documents linked here should be considered historical.
Many were never completely implemented.

# Releasing Taskwarrior

To release Taskwarrior, follow this process:

- Examine the changes since the last version, and update `src/commands/CmdNews.cpp` accordingly.
  There are instructions at the top of the file.
- Create a release PR
    - Update version in CMakeLists.txt
    - Update Changelog
    - get this merged
- On `develop` after that PR merges, create a release tarball:
  - `git clone . release-tarball`
  - `cd release-tarball/`
  - `cmake -S. -Bbuild`
  - `make -Cbuild package_source`
  - copy build/task-*.tar.gz elsewhere and delete the `release-tarball` dir
  - NOTE: older releases had a `test-*.tar.gz` but it's unclear how to generate this
- Update `stable` to the released commit and push upstream
- Tag the commit as vX.Y.Z and push the tag upstream
- Find the tag under https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/tags and create a release from it
  - Give it a clever title if you can think of one; refer to previous releases
  - Include the tarball from earlier
- Update https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/tw.org
  - Add a new item in `content/news`
  - Update `data/projects.json` with the latest version and a fake next version for "devel"
  - Update `data/releases.json` with the new version, and copy the tarball into `content/download`.

.SH NAME
task-sync \- A discussion and tutorial for the various
.BR task (1)
data synchronization capabilities.

.SH INTRODUCTION

Taskwarrior can synchronize your tasks to a server. This has a few benefits:
.br
  - Makes your tasks accessible from multiple systems, called "replicas".
.br
  - Provides a backup of your tasks.
.br
  - Saves disk space.

For example, you might want a replica of your tasks on your laptop and on your phone.

NOTE: A side-effect of synchronization is that once changes have been
synchronized, they cannot be undone. This means that each time synchronization
is run, it is no longer possible to undo previous operations.

.SH CONFIGURATION

To synchronize your tasks to a sync server, you will need the following
information from the server administrator:

.br
  - The server's URL ("origin", such as "https://tw.example.com")
.br
  - A client key ("client_key") identifying your tasks
.br
  - An encryption secret ("encryption_secret") used to encrypt and decrypt your tasks. This can be any secret string, and must match for all replicas using the same client key.

Tools such as
.BR pwgen (1)
can generate suitable secret values.

Configure Taskwarrior with these details:

    $ task config sync.server.origin            <origin>
    $ task config sync.server.client_key        <client_key>
    $ task config sync.server.encryption_secret <encryption_secret>

.SS Adding a Replica

To add a new replica, configure a new, empty replica identically to
the existing replica, and run `task sync`.

.SS When to Synchronize

Taskwarrior can perform a sync operation at every garbage collection (gc) run.
This is the default, and is appropriate for local synchronization.

For synchronization to a server, a better solution is to run

    $ task sync

periodically, such as via
.BR cron (8) .

.SS Local Synchronization

In order to take advantage of synchronization's side effect of saving disk
space without setting up a remote server, it is possible to sync tasks locally.
To configure local sync:

    $ task config sync.local.server_dir /path/to/sync

The default configuration is to sync to a database in the task directory
("data.location").

.SH RUNNING TASKCHAMPION-SYNC-SERVER

The Taskchampion sync server is an HTTP server supporting multiple users.
Users are identified by a client key, and users with different client keys are
entirely independent.  Task data is encrypted by Taskwarrior, and the sync
server never sees un-encrypted data.

To start the server, run it in your preferred HTTP hosting environment, using
`--port` to set the TCP port on which it should listen.  It is recommended to
use TLS to protect communications with the server, but this is not required.

The server stores its data in a database, the path to which is given by the
`--data-dir` argument, defaulting to "/var/lib/taskchampion-sync-server".

For example:

    $ taskchampion-sync-server --port 8443 --data-dir /storage/taskdata

.SS Adding a New User

To add a new user to the server, invent a new client key with a tool like
`uuidgen` or an online UUID generator. There is no need to configure the server
for this new client key: the sync server will automatically create a new user
whenever presented with a new client key.  Supply the key, along with the
origin, to the user for inclusion in their Taskwarrior config. The user should
invent their own "encryption_secret".

.SH AVOIDING DUPLICATE RECURRING TASKS

If you run multiple clients that sync to the same server, you will need to run
this command on your primary client (the one you use most often):

    $ task config recurrence on

And on the other clients, run:

    $ task config recurrence off

This protects you against the effects of a sync/duplication bug.

.SH ALTERNATIVE: FILE SHARING SERVICES

There are many file sharing services, such as DropBox, Amazon S3, Google Drive,
SkyDrive and more.  This technique involves storing your .task directory in a
shared directory under the control of the file hosting services.

Syncing happens quickly, although it is possible to run into conflict situations
when there is no network connectivity, and the tasks are modified in two
separate locations.  This is because the file hosting service knows only about
files, and it has no idea how to merge tasks.  Avoid this problem by never
modifying the same task on two machines, without an intervening sync.

Setup simply involves creating the directory and modifying your data.location
configuration variable like this:

    $ task config data.location /path/to/shared/directory

Strengths:
.br
  - Good client support
.br
  - Easy setup
.br
  - Transparent use

Weaknesses:
.br
  - Tasks are not properly merged

.SH NAME
taskrc \- Configuration file for the task(1) command

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $HOME/.taskrc
.br
.B task rc:<directory-path>/.taskrc ...
.br
.B TASKRC=<directory-path>/.taskrc task ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B taskwarrior
obtains its configuration data from a file called
.I .taskrc
\&. This file is normally located in the user's home directory:

.RS
$HOME/.taskrc
.RE

The default location can be overridden using the
.I rc:
attribute when running task:

.RS
$ task rc:<directory-path>/.taskrc ...
.RE

or using the TASKRC environment variable:

.RS
$ TASKRC=/tmp/.taskrc task ...
.RE

Individual options can be overridden by using the
.I rc.<name>:
attribute when running task:

.RS
$ task rc.<name>:<value> ...
.RE

or

.RS
$ task rc.<name>=<value> ...
.RE

If
.B taskwarrior
is run without an existing configuration file it will ask if it should create a
default, sample
.I .taskrc
file in the user's home directory.

The taskwarrior configuration file consists of a series of assignments in each
line.  The assignments have the syntax:

.RS
<name-of-configuration-variable>=<value-to-be-set>
.RE

where:
.RS
.TP
<name-of-configuration-variable>
is one of the variables described below

.TP
<value-to-be-set>
is the value the variable is to be set to.
.RE

and set a configuration variable to a certain value. The equal sign ("=") is
used to separate the variable name from the value to be set.

The hash mark, or pound sign ("#") is used as a comment character. It can be
used to annotate the configuration file. All text after the character to the end
of the line is ignored.

Note that taskwarrior is flexible about the values used to represent Boolean
items.  You can use "on", "yes", "y", "1" and "true".
Anything else means "off".

.SH EDITING
You can edit your .taskrc file by hand if you wish, or you can use the 'config'
command.  To permanently set a value in your .taskrc file, use this command:

.RS
$ task config nag "You have higher priority tasks!"
.RE

To delete an entry, use this command:

.RS
$ task config nag
.RE

Taskwarrior will then use the default value.  To explicitly set a value to
blank, and therefore avoid using the default value, use this command:

.RS
$ task config nag ""
.RE

Taskwarrior will also display all your settings with this command:

.RS
$ task show
.RE

and in addition, will also perform a check of all the values in the file,
warning you of anything it finds amiss.

.SH NESTING CONFIGURATION FILES
The .taskrc can include other files containing configuration settings by using the
.B include
statement:

.RS
include <path/to/the/configuration/file/to/be/included>
.RE

By using include files you can divide your main configuration file into several
ones containing just the relevant configuration data like colors, etc.

There are two excellent uses of includes in your .taskrc, shown here:

.RS
include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/holidays.en-US.rc
.br
include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/dark-16.theme
.RE

This includes two standard files that are distributed with taskwarrior, which
define a set of US holidays, and set up a 16-color theme to use, to color the
reports and calendar.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
These environmant variables override defaults and command line arguments.

.TP
.B TASKDATA=~/.task
This overrides the default path for the taskwarrior data files.

.TP
.B TASKRC=~/.taskrc
This overrides the default RC file.

.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
Valid variable names and their default values are:

.SS FILES

.TP
.B data.location=$HOME/.task
This is a path to the directory containing all the taskwarrior files. By
default, it is set up to be ~/.task, for example: /home/paul/.task

Note that you can use the
.B ~
shell meta character, which will be properly expanded.

Note that the TASKDATA environment variable overrides this setting.

.TP
.B locking=on
Determines whether to use file locking when accessing the pending.data and
completed.data files.  Defaults to "on". Solaris users who store the data
files on an NFS mount may need to set locking to "off". Note that there is
danger in setting this value to "off" - another program (or another instance of
task) may write to the task.pending file at the same time.

.TP
.B gc=on
Can be used to temporarily suspend garbage collection (gc), so that task IDs
don't change.  Note that this should be used in the form of a command line
override (task rc.gc=off ...), and not permanently used in the .taskrc file,
as this significantly affects performance in the long term.

.TP
.B exit.on.missing.db=no
When set to 'yes' causes the program to exit if the database (~/.task or
rc.data.location or TASKDATA override) is missing.  Default value is 'no'.

.SS TERMINAL
.TP
.B detection=on
Determines whether to use ioctl to establish the size of the window you are
using, for text wrapping.

.TP
.B defaultwidth=80
The width of output used when auto-detection support is not available. Defaults
to 80.  If set to 0, it is interpreted as infinite width, therefore with no
word-wrapping; this is useful when redirecting report output to a file for subsequent
handling.

.TP
.B defaultheight=24
The height of output used when auto-detection support is not available. Defaults
to 24.  If set to 0, it is interpreted as infinite height. This is useful when redirecting
charts to a file for subsequent handling.

.TP
.B avoidlastcolumn=no
Causes the width of the terminal minus one to be used as the full width.  This
avoids placing color codes in the last column which can cause problems for
Cygwin users.  Default value is 'no'.

.TP
.B hyphenate=on
Hyphenates lines when wrapping breaks occur mid-word.  Default value is 'on'.

.TP
.B editor=vi
Specifies which text editor you wish to use for when the
.B task edit <ID>
command is used. Taskwarrior will first look for this configuration variable. If
found, it is used.  Otherwise it will look for the $VISUAL or $EDITOR
environment variables, before it defaults to using "vi".

.TP
.B edit.verbose=on
When set to on (the default), helpful explanatory comments are added to the
edited file when using the "task edit ..." command.  Setting this to off means
that you would see a smaller, more compact representation of the task, with no
help text.  Deprecated - use verbosity token 'edit'.

.TP
.B reserved.lines=1
This is the number of lines reserved at the bottom of the screen for the shell
prompt.  This is only referenced when 'limit:page' is used.

.SS MISCELLANEOUS

.TP
.B verbose=on|off|nothing|list...
When set to "on" (the default), helpful explanatory comments are added to all
output from Taskwarrior.  Setting this to "off" means that you would see regular
output.

The special value "nothing" can be used to eliminate all optional output, which
results in only the formatted data being shown, with nothing else.  This output
is most readily parsed and used by shell scripts.

Alternatively, you can specify a comma-separated list of verbosity tokens that
control specific occasions when output is generated.  This list may contain:

    blank      Inserts extra blank lines in output, for clarity
    header     Messages that appear before report output
    footnote   Messages that appear after report output
    label      Column labels on tabular reports
    new-id     Provides feedback of any new task IDs
    affected   Reports 'N tasks affected' and similar
    edit       Used the verbose template for the 'edit' command
    special    Feedback when applying special tags
    project    Feedback about project status changes
    sync       Feedback about the need for sync

Note that the "on" setting is equivalent to all the tokens being specified,
and the "nothing" setting is equivalent to none of the tokens being specified.

Here are the shortcut equivalents:

    verbose=on
    verbose=blank,header,footnote,label,new-id,affected,edit,special,project,sync

    verbose=off
    verbose=blank,label,new-id,edit

    verbose=nothing
    verbose=

Those additional comments are sent to the standard error for header, footnote
and project.  The others are sent to standard output.

.TP
.B confirmation=yes
May be "yes" or "no", and determines whether taskwarrior will ask for
confirmation before deleting a task, performing bulk changes, or the undo
command.  The default value is "yes".  Consider leaving this setting as "yes",
for safety.

.TP
.B echo.command=yes
May be "yes" or "no", and causes the display of the ID and description of any
task when you run the start, stop, do, undo or delete commands. The default
value is "yes".  Deprecated - use verbosity tokens 'header' and  'affected'.

.TP
.B indent.annotation=2
Controls the number of spaces to indent annotations when shown beneath the
description field.  The default value is "2".

.TP
.B indent.report=0
Controls the indentation of the entire report output.  Default is "0".

.TP
.B row.padding=0
Controls left and right padding around each row of the report output.  Default is "0".

.TP
.B column.padding=0
Controls padding between columns of the report output.  Default is "1".

.TP
.B bulk=3
Is a number, defaulting to 3.  When this number or greater of tasks are modified
in a single command, confirmation will be required, unless the
.B confirmation
variable is "no".

This is useful for preventing large-scale unintended changes.

.TP
.B nag=You have higher priority tasks.
This may be a string of text, or blank. It is used as a prompt when a task is
started or completed that is not considered high priority.  Default value is:
You have higher priority tasks.  It is a gentle reminder that you are
contradicting your own priority settings.

.TP
.B complete.all.projects=yes
May be yes or no, and determines whether the tab completion scripts consider all
the project names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks.  The
default value is "no".

.TP
.B list.all.projects=yes
May be yes or no, and determines whether the 'projects' command lists all the project
names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks.  The default value is
"no".

.TP
.B complete.all.tags=yes
May be yes or no, and determines whether the tab completion scripts consider all
the tag names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks.  The default
value is "no".

.TP
.B list.all.tags=yes
May be yes or no, and determines whether the 'tags' command lists all the tag
names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks.  The default value is
"no".

.TP
.B print.empty.columns=no
May be yes or no, and determines whether columns with no data for any task are
printed.  Defaults to no.

.TP
.B search.case.sensitive=yes
May be yes or no, and determines whether keyword lookup and substitutions on the
description and annotations are done in a case sensitive way.  Defaults to yes.

.TP
.B regex=off
Controls whether regular expression support is enabled.
The default value is off, because this advanced feature could cause confusion
among users that are not comfortable with regular expressions.

.TP
.B xterm.title=no
Sets the xterm window title when reports are run.  Defaults to off.

.TP
.B patterns=on
Enables or disables pattern support on the command line, such as /foo/.
Defaults to on.

.TP
.B expressions=on
Enables or disables algebraic expression support on the command line, such as
"due<eom and (pri=H or pri=M)".  Defaults to on.

.TP
.B dom=on
Enables or disables access to taskwarrior internals and task metadata on the
command line.  Defaults to on.

.TP
.B json.array=off
Determines whether the query command encloses the JSON output in '[...]' to
create a properly-formed JSON array.  Defaults to off.

.TP
.B _forcecolor=no
Taskwarrior shuts off color automatically when the output is not sent directly
to a TTY.  For example, this command:

.RS
.RS
$ task list > file
.RE

will not use any color.  To override this, use:

.RS
$ task rc._forcecolor=yes list > file
.RE
.RE

.TP
.B active.indicator=*
The character or string to show in the start.active column.  Defaults to *.

.TP
.B tag.indicator=+
The character or string to show in the tag.indicator column.  Defaults to +.

.TP
.B dependency.indicator=D
The character or string to show in the depends.indicator column.  Defaults to +.

.TP
.B recurrence.indicator=R
The character or string to show in the recurrence_indicator column.  Defaults to R.

.TP
.B recurrence.limit=1
The number of future recurring tasks to show.  Defaults to 1.  For example, if a
weekly recurring task is added with a due date of tomorrow, and recurrence.limit
is set to 2, then a report will list 2 pending recurring tasks, one for tomorrow,
and one for a week from tomorrow.

.TP
.B undo.style=side
When the 'undo' command is run, taskwarrior presents a before and after
comparison of the data.  This can be in either the 'side' style, which compares
values side-by-side in a table, or 'diff' style, which uses a format similar to
the 'diff' command.

.TP
.B burndown.bias=0.666
The burndown bias is a number that lies within the range 0 <= bias <= 1.  The bias
is the fraction of the find/fix rates derived from the short-term data (last
25% of the report) versus the longer term data (last 50% of the report).  A
value of 0.666 (the default) means that the short-term rate has twice the weight
of the longer-term rate.  The calculation is as follows:

    rate = (long-term-rate * (1 - bias)) + (short-term-rate * bias)

.TP
.B abbreviation.minimum=2
Minimum length of any abbreviated command/value.  This means that "ve", "ver",
"vers", "versi", "versio" will all equate to "version", but "v" will not.
Default is 2.

.TP
.B debug=off
Taskwarrior has a debug mode that causes diagnostic output to be displayed.
Typically this is not something anyone would want, but when reporting a bug,
debug output can be useful.  It can also help explain how the command line is
being parsed, but the information is displayed in a developer-friendly, not a
user-friendly way.

.TP
.B alias.rm=delete
Taskwarrior supports command aliases.  This alias provides an alternate name
(rm) for the delete command.  You can use aliases to provide alternate names for
any of the commands.  Several commands you may use are actually aliases -
the 'history' report, for example, or 'export'.

.SS EXTENSIONS
.TP
.B extensions=on
Enables the extension system.  Defaults to on.

.SS DATES

.TP
.B dateformat=Y-M-D
.TP
.B dateformat.report=
.TP
.B dateformat.holiday=YMD
.TP
.B dateformat.edit=Y-M-D H:N:S
.TP
.B dateformat.info=Y-M-D H:N:S
.TP
.B dateformat.annotation=
.TP
.B report.X.dateformat=Y-M-D
This is a string of characters that defines how taskwarrior formats date values.
The precedence order for the configuration variable is report.X.dateformat then
dateformat.report then dateformat for formating the due dates in reports.
If both report.X.dateformat and dateformat.report are not set then dateformat
will be applied
to the date.  Entered dates as well as all other displayed dates in reports
are formatted according to dateformat.

The default value is the ISO-8601 standard: Y-M-D.  The string can contain the
characters:

.RS
.RS
m  minimal-digit month,   for example 1 or 12
.br
d  minimal-digit day,     for example 1 or 30
.br

Undefined fields are put to their minimal valid values (1 for month and day and
0 for hour, minutes and seconds) when there is at least one more global date
field that is set.  Otherwise, they are set to the corresponding values of
"now".  For example:
.RE

.RS
.RS
.br
8/1/2013  with m/d/Y   implies August 1, 2013 at midnight (inferred)

offset value specified in calendar.offset.value. It defaults to "off".

.TP
.B calendar.offset.value=-1
The offset value to apply to the first month in the calendar report. The default
value is "-1".

.TP
.B calendar.holidays=full
If set to full running "task calendar" will display holidays in the calendar by
color-coding the corresponding days.  A detailed list with the dates and names
of the holidays is also shown.  If set to sparse only the days are color-coded
and no details on the holidays will be displayed. The displaying of holidays is
turned off by setting the variable to none.  The default value is "none".

.TP
.B calendar.legend=yes
Determines whether the calendar legend is displayed.  The default value is "yes".

.SS JOURNAL ENTRIES

.TP
.B journal.time=no
May be yes or no, and determines whether the 'start' and 'stop' commands should
record an annotation when being executed. The default value is "no". The text of
the corresponding annotations is controlled by:

.RE

Taskwarrior has a number of coloration rules.  They correspond to a particular
attribute of a task, such as it being due, or being active, and specifies the
automatic coloring of that task.  A list of valid colors, depending on your
terminal, can be obtained by running the command:

.RS
.B task color
.RE

.RS
Note that no default values are listed here - the defaults now correspond to the
dark-256.theme (Linux) and dark-16.theme (other) theme values.

.SS SHADOW FILE

.TP
.B
shadow.file=$HOME/.task/shadow.txt
If specified, designates a file path that will be automatically written to by
taskwarrior, whenever the task database changes.  In other words, it is
automatically kept up to date.  The shadow.command configuration variable is
used to determine which report is written to the shadow file.  There is no color
used in the shadow file. This feature can be useful in maintaining a current
file for use by programs like GeekTool, Conky or Samurize.

.TP
.B
shadow.command=list
This is the command that is run to maintain the shadow file, determined by the
.I shadow.file
configuration variable. The format is identical to that of
.I default.command
\&. Please see the corresponding documentation for that command.

.TP
.B
shadow.notify=on
When this value is set to "on", taskwarrior will display a message whenever the
shadow file is updated by some task command.

.SS PUSH/PULL/MERGE

See the 'man task-synch' page for more details regarding usage.

.TP
.B merge.autopush=yes|no|ask
.RS
Determines post-merge behavior regarding automatic push.
.RE

.B merge.default.uri
.RS
Default merge URI.
.RE

.B pull.default.uri
.RS
Default pull URI.
.RE

.B push.default.uri
.RS
Default push URI.
.RE

.SS DEFAULTS

.TP
.B
default.project=foo
Provides a default project name for the
.I task add
command, if you don't specify one.  The default is blank.

.TP
.B
default.priority=M
Provides a default priority for the
.I task add
command, if you don't specify one.  The default is blank.

.TP
.B
default.due=...
Provides a default due date for the
.I task add
command, if you don't specify one.  The default is blank.

.TP
.B
default.command=next
Provides a default command that is run every time taskwarrior is invoked with no
arguments.  For example, if set to:

.RS
.RS
default.command=project:foo list
.RE
.RE

.RS
then taskwarrior will run the "project:foo list" command if no command is
specified.  This means that by merely typing
.RE

.RS
.RS
$ task
.br
[task project:foo list]
.br
\&
.br
ID Project Pri Description
 1 foo     H   Design foo
 2 foo         Build foo
.RE
.RE

.SS REPORTS

The reports can be customized by using the following configuration variables.
The output columns, their labels and the sort order can be set using the
corresponding variables for each report. Each report name is used as a
"command" name. For example

.TP
.B task overdue

.TP
.B report.X.description
The description for report X when running the "task help" command.

.TP
.B report.X.columns
The columns that will be used when generating the report X. Valid columns are:
id, uuid, status, project, priority, priority_long, entry, start, end, due,
countdown, countdown_compact, age, age_compact, active, tags, depends,
description_only, description, recur, recurrence_indicator, tag_indicator and
wait.  The IDs are separated by commas.

.TP
.B report.X.labels
The labels for each column that will be used when generating report X. The
labels are a comma separated list.

.TP
.B report.X.sort
The sort order of the tasks in the generated report X. The sort order is
specified by using the column ids post-fixed by a "+" for ascending sort order
or a "-" for descending sort order. The sort IDs are separated by commas.
For example:

    report.list.sort=due+,priority-,active-,project+

.TP
.B report.X.filter
This adds a filter to the report X so that only tasks matching the filter
criteria are displayed in the generated report.

.TP
.B report.X.dateformat
This adds a dateformat to the report X that will be used by the "due date"
column. If it is not set then dateformat.report and dateformat will be used in
this order. See the
.B DATES
section for details on the sequence placeholders.

.TP
.B report.X.annotations
This adds the possibility to control the output of annotations for a task in a
report. See the
.B annotations
variable for details on the possible values.  Deprecated.

.TP
.B report.X.limit
An optional value to a report limiting the number of displayed tasks in the
generated report.  Deprecated.

.TP
Taskwarrior comes with a number of predefined reports, which are:

.TP
.B next
Lists the most important tasks.

.TP
.B long
Lists all pending tasks and all data, matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B list
Lists all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B ls
Short listing of all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B minimal
Minimal listing of all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B newest
Shows the newest tasks.

.TP
.B oldest
Shows the oldest tasks.

.TP
.B overdue
Lists overdue tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B active
Lists active tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B completed
Lists completed tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B recurring
Lists recurring tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B waiting
Lists all waiting tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B all
Lists all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B blocked
Lists all tasks that have dependencies.

.SS USER DEFINED ATTRIBUTES

User defined attributes (UDAs) are an extension mechanism that allows you to
define new attributes for Taskwarrior to store and display.  One such example is
an 'estimate' attribute that could be used to store time estimates associated
with a task.  This 'estimate' attribute is not built in to Taskwarrior, but with
a few simple configuration settings you can instruct Taskwarrior to store this
item, and provide access to it for custom reports and filters.

This allows you to augment Taskwarrior to accommodate your workflow, or bend the
rules and use Taskwarrior to store and synch data that is not necessarily
task-related.

One important restriction is that because this is an open system that allows
the definition of any new attribute, Taskwarrior cannot understand the meaning
of that attribute.  So while Taskwarrior will faithfully store, modify, report,
sort and filter your UDA, it does not understand anything about it.  For example
if you define a UDA named 'estimate', Taskwarrior will not know that this value
is weeks, hours, minutes, money, or some other resource count.

.TP
.B uda.<name>.type=string|numeric|date|duration
.RS
Defines a UDA called '<name>', of the specified type.
.RE

.TP
.B uda.<name>.label=<column heading>
.RS
Provides a default report label for the UDA called '<name>'.
.RE

.TP
.B uda.<name>.values=A,B,C
.RS
For type 'string' UDAs only, this provides a comma-separated list of acceptable
values.  In this example, the '<name>' UDA may only contain values 'A', 'B',
or 'C', but may also contain no value.
.RE

.TP
.B Example 'estimate' UDA
This example shows an 'estimate' UDA that stores specific values for the size
of a task.

.RS
.B uda.estimate.type=string
.br
.B uda.estimate.label=Size Estimate
.br
.B uda.estimate.values=trivial,small,medium,large,huge

.SH NAME
taskrc \- Configuration details for the task(1) command

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $HOME/.taskrc
.br
.B task rc:<directory-path>/.taskrc ...
.br
.B TASKRC=<directory-path>/.taskrc task ...
.br
.B XDG_CONFIG_HOME=<directory-path>/task/taskrc task ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Taskwarrior
obtains its configuration data from a file called
.I .taskrc
\&. This file is normally located in the user's home directory:

.nf
    $HOME/.taskrc
.fi

The default location can be overridden using the
.I rc:
attribute when running task:

.nf
    $ task rc:<directory-path>/.taskrc ...
.fi

or using the TASKRC environment variable:

.nf
    $ TASKRC=/tmp/.taskrc task ...
.fi

Additionally, if no ~/.taskrc exists, taskwarrior will check if the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is defined:

.nf
    $ XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config task ...
.fi

Individual options can be overridden by using the
.I rc.<name>:
attribute when running task:

.nf
    $ task rc.<name>:<value> ...
.fi

or

.nf
    $ task rc.<name>=<value> ...
.fi

If
.B Taskwarrior
is run without an existing configuration file it will ask if it should create a
default, sample
.I .taskrc
file in the user's home directory.

The .taskrc file follows a very simple syntax defining name/value pairs:

.nf
    <name> = <value>
.fi

There may be whitespace around <name>, '=' and <value>, and it is ignored.
Whitespace within the <value> is left intact.
Whitespace is not permitted in comma-separated lists.
The entry must be on a single line, no continuations.
Values support UTF8 as well as JSON encoding, such as \\uNNNN.

Note that Taskwarrior is flexible about the values used to represent Boolean
items. You can use "1" to enable, anything else is interpreted as disabled.
The values "on", "yes", "y" and "true" are also supported.

.nf
    include <file>
.fi

There may be whitespace around 'include' and <file>. The file may be an
absolute or relative path, and the special character '~' is expanded to mean
$HOME. If relative path is specified, the it will be evaluated as relative with
respect to the following directories (listed in order of precedence):
1. the current working directory
2. the directory containing the taskrc file
3. the directories set by the package manager (which usually contain
   pre-defined themes)

Note that environment variables are also expanded in paths (and any other
taskrc variables).

.nf
    # <comment>
.fi

A comment consists of the character '#', and extends from the '#' to the end
of the line. There is no way to comment a multi-line block. There may be
blank lines.

Almost every value has a default setting, and an empty .taskrc file is one
that makes use of every default. The contents of the .taskrc file therefore
represent overrides of the default values. To remove a default value completely
there must be an entry like this:

.nf
    <name> =
.fi

This entry overrides the default value with a blank value.

.SH EDITING
You can edit your .taskrc file by hand if you wish, or you can use the 'config'
command. To permanently set a value in your .taskrc file, use this command:

.nf
    $ task config nag "You have more urgent tasks."
.fi

To delete an entry, use this command:

.nf
    $ task config nag
.fi

Taskwarrior will then use the default value. To explicitly set a value to
blank, and therefore avoid using the default value, use this command:

.nf
    $ task config nag ""
.fi

Taskwarrior will also display all your settings with this command:

.nf
    $ task show
.fi

and in addition, will also perform a check of all the values in the file,
warning you of anything it finds amiss.

.SH NESTING CONFIGURATION FILES
The .taskrc can include other files containing configuration settings by using the
.B include
statement:

.nf
    include <path/to/the/configuration/file/to/be/included>
.fi

By using include files you can divide your main configuration file into several
ones containing just the relevant configuration data like colors, etc.

There are two excellent uses of includes in your .taskrc, shown here:

.nf
    include holidays.en-US.rc
    include dark-16.theme
.fi

This includes two standard files that are distributed with Taskwarrior, which
define a set of US holidays, and set up a 16-color theme to use, to color the
reports and calendar.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
These environment variables override defaults, but not command-line arguments.

.TP
.B TASKDATA=~/.task
This overrides the default path for the Taskwarrior data.

.TP
.B TASKRC=~/.taskrc
This overrides the default RC file.
.RE

This environment variable will be checked if
.I ~/.taskrc
doesn't exist

.TP
.B XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config
If set, taskwarrior will look for a
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc
file

.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
Valid variable names and their default values are:

.SS FILES

.TP
.B data.location=$HOME/.task
This is a path to the directory containing all the Taskwarrior data. By
default, it is set up to be ~/.task, for example: /home/paul/.task

Note that you can use the
.B ~
shell meta character, which will be properly expanded.

Note that the TASKDATA environment variable overrides this setting.

.TP
.B hooks.location=$HOME/.task/hooks
This is a path to the hook scripts directory. By default it is ~/.task/hooks.

.TP
.B gc=1
Can be used to temporarily suspend rebuilding, so that task IDs don't change.
Note that this should be used in the form of a command line override (task
rc.gc=0 ...), and not permanently used in the .taskrc file, as this
significantly affects performance in the long term.

.TP
.B purge.on-sync=0
If set, old tasks will be purged automatically after each synchronization.
Tasks are identified as "old" when they have status "Deleted" and have not
been modified for 180 days.

.TP
.B hooks=1
This master control switch enables hook script processing. The default value
is '1', but certain extensions and environments may need to disable hooks.

.TP
.B exit.on.missing.db=0
When set to '1' causes the program to exit if the database (~/.task or
rc.data.location or TASKDATA override) is missing. Default value is '0'.

.SS TERMINAL
.TP
.B detection=1
Determines whether to use ioctl to establish the size of the window you are
using, for text wrapping.

.TP
.B limit:25
Specifies the desired number of tasks a report should show, if a positive
integer is given.  The value 'page' may also be used, and will limit the
report output to as many lines of text as will fit on screen. Default value
is '25'.

.TP
.B defaultwidth=80
The width of output used when auto-detection support is not available. Defaults
to 80. If set to 0, it is interpreted as infinite width, therefore with no
word-wrapping; this is useful when redirecting report output to a file for subsequent
handling.

.TP
.B defaultheight=24
The height of output used when auto-detection support is not available. Defaults
to 24. If set to 0, it is interpreted as infinite height. This is useful when redirecting
charts to a file for subsequent handling.

.TP
.B avoidlastcolumn=0
Causes the width of the terminal minus one to be used as the full width. This
avoids placing color codes in the last column which can cause problems for
Cygwin users. Default value is '0'.

.TP
.B hyphenate=1
Hyphenates lines when wrapping breaks occur mid-word. Default value is '1'.

.TP
.B editor=vi
Specifies which text editor you wish to use for when the
.B task edit <ID>
command is used. Taskwarrior will first look for this configuration variable. If
found, it is used. Otherwise it will look for the $VISUAL or $EDITOR
environment variables, before it defaults to using "vi".

.TP
.B reserved.lines=1
This is the number of lines reserved at the bottom of the screen for the shell
prompt. This is only referenced when 'limit:page' is used.

.SS MISCELLANEOUS

.TP
.B verbose=1|0|nothing|list...
When set to "1" (the default), helpful explanatory comments are added to all
output from Taskwarrior. Setting this to "0" means that you would see regular
output.

The special value "nothing" can be used to eliminate all optional output, which
results in only the formatted data being shown, with nothing else. This output
is most readily parsed and used by shell scripts.

Alternatively, you can specify a comma-separated list of verbosity tokens that
control specific occasions when output is generated. This list may contain:

.nf
    blank      Inserts extra blank lines in output, for clarity
    header     Messages that appear before report output (this includes .taskrc/.task overrides and the "[task next]" message)
    footnote   Messages that appear after report output (mostly status messages and change descriptions)
    label      Column labels on tabular reports
    new-id     Provides feedback on any new task with IDs (and UUIDs for new tasks with ID 0, such as new completed tasks).
    new-uuid   Provides feedback on any new task with UUIDs. Overrides new-id. Useful for automation.
    news       Reminds to read new release highlights until the user runs "task news".
    affected   Reports 'N tasks affected' and similar
    edit       Used the verbose template for the 'edit' command
    special    Feedback when applying special tags
    project    Feedback about project status changes
    sync       Feedback about sync
    filter     Shows the filter used in the command
    context    Show the current context. Displayed in footnote.
    override   Notification when configuration options are overridden
    recur      Notification when a new recurring task instance is created
    default    Notifications about taskwarrior choosing to perform a default action.
.fi

The tokens "affected", "new-id", "new-uuid", "project", "override" and "recur"
imply "footnote".

The token "default" implies "header".

Note that the "1" setting is equivalent to all the tokens being specified,
and the "nothing" setting is equivalent to none of the tokens being specified.

Here are the shortcut equivalents:

.nf
    verbose=on
    verbose=blank,header,footnote,label,new-id,news,affected,edit,special,project,sync,filter,override,recur
.fi

.nf
    verbose=0
    verbose=blank,label,new-id,edit
.fi

.nf
    verbose=nothing
    verbose=
.fi

Those additional comments are sent to the standard error for header, footnote
and project. The others are sent to standard output.

.TP
.B confirmation=1
May be "1" or "0", and determines whether Taskwarrior will ask for
confirmation before deleting a task or performing the undo command. The default
value is "1". Consider leaving this enabled, for safety.

.TP
.B allow.empty.filter=1
An empty filter combined with a write command is potentially a way to modify
all tasks by mistake, and when this is detected, confirmation is required.
Setting this to '0' means that it is an error to use a write command with no
filter.

.TP
.B indent.annotation=2
Controls the number of spaces to indent annotations when shown beneath the
description field. The default value is "2".

.TP
.B indent.report=0
Controls the indentation of the entire report output. Default is "0".

.TP
.B row.padding=0
Controls left and right padding around each row of the report output. Default is "0".

.TP
.B column.padding=0
Controls padding between columns of the report output. Default is "1".

.TP
.B bulk=3
Is a number, defaulting to 3. When this number or greater of tasks are modified
in a single command, confirmation will be required, regardless of the value of
.B confirmation
variable. The special value bulk=0 is treated as an infinity.

This is useful for preventing large-scale unintended changes.

.TP
.B nag=You have more urgent tasks.
This may be a string of text, or blank.  It is used as a prompt when a task is
started of completed, when there are other tasks with a higher urgency.
Default value is: 'You have more urgent tasks'.
It is a gentle reminder that you are contradicting your own urgency settings.

.TP
.B list.all.projects=0
May be "1" or "0", and determines whether the 'projects' command lists all the project
names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks. The default value is
"0".

.TP
.B summary.all.projects=0
If set to "1", shows all projects in the summary report, even if there are no
pending tasks.  The default value is "0".

.TP
.B complete.all.tags=1
May be "1" or "0", and determines whether the tab completion scripts consider all
the tag names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks. The default
value is "0".

.TP
.B list.all.tags=1
May be "1" or "0", and determines whether the 'tags' command lists all the tag
names you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks. The default value is
"0".

.TP
.B print.empty.columns=1
May be "1" or "0", and determines whether columns with no data for any task are
printed. Defaults to "0".

.TP
.B search.case.sensitive=1
May be "1" or "0", and determines whether keyword lookup and substitutions on the
description and annotations are done in a case sensitive way. Defaults to "1" on
most platforms. Defaults to "0" on Cygwin due to older regex library problems with
case-insensitivity.

.TP
.B regex=1
Controls whether regular expression support is enabled. The default value is "1".

.TP
.B xterm.title=1
Sets the xterm window title when reports are run. Defaults to "0".

.TP
.B expressions=infix|postfix
Sets a preference for infix expressions (1 + 2) or postfix expressions (1 2 +).
Defaults to infix.

.TP
.B json.array=1
Determines whether the export command encloses the JSON output in '[...]' and
adds ',' after each exported task object to create a properly-formed JSON
array.
With json.array=0, export writes raw JSON objects to STDOUT, one per line.
Defaults to "1".

.TP
.B _forcecolor=1
Taskwarrior shuts off color automatically when the output is not sent directly
to a TTY. For example, this command:

.RS
.RS
$ task list > file
.RE

will not use any color. To override this, use:

.RS
$ task rc._forcecolor=yes list > file
.RE
.RE

Defaults to "0".

.TP
.B active.indicator=*
The character or string to show in the start.active column. Defaults to *.

.TP
.B tag.indicator=+
The character or string to show in the tag.indicator column. Defaults to +.

.TP
.B dependency.indicator=D
The character or string to show in the depends.indicator column. Defaults to D.

.TP
.B uda.<name>.indicator=U
The character or string to show in the <uda>.indicator column. Defaults to U.

.TP
.B recurrence=1
Controls whether recurrence is enabled, and whether recurring tasks continue to
generate new task instances. Defaults to "1".

If you are syncing multiple clients, then it is advised that you set 'recurrence=1'
on your primary client, and 'recurrence=0' on ALL other clients. This is a workaround
for a duplication bug.

.TP
.B recurrence.confirmation=prompt
Controls whether changes to recurring tasks propagates to other child tasks with
or without confirmation. A value of 'yes' means propagate changes without
confirmation. A value of 'no' means do not propagate changes and don't ask for
confirmation. A value of 'prompt' prompts you every time. Defaults to 'prompt'.

.TP
.B recurrence.indicator=R
The character or string to show in the recurrence_indicator column. Defaults to R.

.TP
.B recurrence.limit=1
The number of future recurring tasks to show. Defaults to 1. For example, if a
weekly recurring task is added with a due date of tomorrow, and recurrence.limit
is set to 2, then a report will list 2 pending recurring tasks, one for tomorrow,
and one for a week from tomorrow.

.TP
.B undo.style=side
When the 'undo' command is run, Taskwarrior presents a before and after
comparison of the data. This can be in either the 'side' style, which compares
values side-by-side in a table, or 'diff' style, which uses a format similar to
the 'diff' command.

Currently not supported.

.TP
.B abbreviation.minimum=2
Minimum length of any abbreviated command/value. This means that "ve", "ver",
"vers", "versi", "versio" will all equate to "version", but "v" will not.
Default is 2.

.TP
.B debug=0
Taskwarrior has a debug mode that causes diagnostic output to be displayed.
Typically this is not something anyone would want, but when reporting a bug,
debug output can be useful. It can also help explain how the command line is
being parsed, but the information is displayed in a developer-friendly, not a
user-friendly way.

Turning debug on automatically sets debug.hooks=1 and  debug.parser=1
if they do not already have assigned values. Defaults to "0".

.TP
.B debug.hooks=0
Controls the hook system diagnostic level. Level 0 means no diagnostics.
Level 1 shows hook calls. Level 2 also shows exit status and I/O.

.TP
.B debug.parser=0
Controls the parser diagnostic level. Level 0 shows no diagnostics.
Level 1 shows the final parse tree.
Level 2 shows the parse tree from all phases of the parse.
Level 3 shows expression evaluation details.

.TP
.B obfuscate=0
When set to '1', will replace all report text with 'xxx'.
This is useful for sharing report output in bug reports.
Default value is '0'.

.TP
.B alias.rm=delete
Taskwarrior supports command aliases. This alias provides an alternate name
(rm) for the delete command. You can use aliases to provide alternate names for
any of the commands. Several commands you may use are actually aliases -
the 'history' report, for example, or 'export'.

.TP
.B burndown.cumulative=1
May be "1" or "0", and controls the behaviour of the burndown command. When set
to 1, it sums up all completed tasks, otherwise they only get plotted in the
interval where the task was completed. Defaults to 1.

.SS DATES

.TP
.B dateformat=Y-M-D
.TP
.B dateformat.report=
.TP
.B dateformat.holiday=YMD
.TP
.B dateformat.edit=Y-M-D H:N:S
.TP
.B dateformat.info=Y-M-D H:N:S
.TP
.B dateformat.annotation=
.TP
.B report.X.dateformat=Y-M-D
This is a string of characters that defines how Taskwarrior formats date values.
The precedence order for the configuration variable is report.X.dateformat then
dateformat.report then dateformat for formatting the due dates in reports.
If both report.X.dateformat and dateformat.report are not set then dateformat
will be applied
to the date. Entered dates as well as all other displayed dates in reports
are formatted according to dateformat.

The default value is the ISO-8601 standard: Y-M-D. The string can contain the
characters:

.nf
    m  minimal-digit month,    for example 1 or 12
    d  minimal-digit day,      for example 1 or 30
    y  two-digit year,         for example 09 or 12
    D  two-digit day,          for example 01 or 30
    M  two-digit month,        for example 01 or 12
    Y  four-digit year,        for example 2009 or 2015
    a  short name of weekday,  for example Mon or Wed
    A  long name of weekday,   for example Monday or Wednesday
    b  short name of month,    for example Jan or Aug
    B  long name of month,     for example January or August
    v  minimal-digit week,     for example 3 or 37
    V  two-digit week,         for example 03 or 37
    h  minimal-digit hour,     for example 3 or 21
    n  minimal-digit minutes,  for example 5 or 42
    s  minimal-digit seconds,  for example 7 or 47
    H  two-digit hour,         for example 03 or 21
    N  two-digit minutes,      for example 05 or 42
    S  two-digit seconds,      for example 07 or 47
    J  three-digit Julian day, for example 023 or 365
    j  Julian day,             for example 23 or 365
    w  Week day,               for example 0 for Monday, 5 for Friday
.fi

.RS
The characters 'v', 'V', 'a' and 'A' can only be used for formatting printed
dates (not to parse them).
.RE

.RS
The string may also contain other characters to act as spacers, or formatting.
Examples for other values of dateformat:
.RE

.nf
    d/m/Y  would use for input and output 24/7/2009
    yMD    would use for input and output 090724
    M-D-Y  would use for input and output 07-24-2009
.fi

.RS
Examples for other values of dateformat.report:
.RE

.nf
    a D b Y (V)   would emit "Fri 24 Jul 2009 (30)"
    A, B D, Y     would emit "Friday, July 24, 2009"
    wV a Y-M-D    would emit "w30 Fri 2009-07-24"
    yMD.HN        would emit "110124.2342"
    m/d/Y H:N     would emit "1/24/2011 10:42"
    a D b Y H:N:S would emit "Mon 24 Jan 2011 11:19:42"
.fi

.RS
Undefined fields are put to their minimal valid values (1 for month and day and
0 for hour, minutes and seconds) when there is at least one more global date
field that is set. Otherwise, they are set to the corresponding values of
"now". For example:
.RE

.nf
    8/1/2013  with m/d/Y   implies August 1, 2013 at midnight (inferred)
    8/1 20:40 with m/d H:N implies August 1, 2013 (inferred) at 20:40
.fi

.TP
.B date.iso=1
Enables ISO-8601 date support.  The default value is "1".

.SS CALENDAR

.TP
.B weekstart=Sunday
Determines the day a week starts. Valid values are Sunday or Monday only. The
default value is "Sunday".

.TP
.B displayweeknumber=1
Determines if week numbers are displayed when using the "task calendar" command.
The week number is dependent on the day a week starts. The default value is
"1".

.TP
.B due=7
This is the number of days into the future that define when a task is
considered due, and is colored accordingly. The default value is 7.

.TP
.B calendar.details=sparse
If set to "full" running "task calendar" will display the details of tasks with
due dates that fall into the calendar period. The corresponding days will be
color-coded in the calendar. If set to "sparse" only the corresponding days will
be color coded and no details will be displayed. The displaying of due dates
with details is turned off by setting the variable to "none". The default value
is "sparse".

.TP
.B calendar.details.report=list
The report to run when displaying the details of tasks with due dates when
running the "task calendar" command. The default value is "list".

.TP
.B calendar.offset=0
If "1" the first month in the calendar report is effectively changed by the
offset value specified in calendar.offset.value. It defaults to "0".

.TP
.B calendar.offset.value=-1
The offset value to apply to the first month in the calendar report. The default
value is "-1".

.TP
.B calendar.holidays=none
If set to full running "task calendar" will display holidays in the calendar by
color-coding the corresponding days. A detailed list with the dates and names
of the holidays is also shown. If set to sparse only the days are color-coded
and no details on the holidays will be displayed. The displaying of holidays is
turned off by setting the variable to none. The default value is "none".

.TP
.B calendar.legend=1
Determines whether the calendar legend is displayed. The default value is "1".

.TP
.B calendar.monthsperline=N
Determines how many months the "task calendar" command renders across the
screen. Defaults to however many will fit. If more months than will fit are
specified, Taskwarrior will only show as many that will fit.

.SS JOURNAL ENTRIES

.TP
.B journal.time=0
May be "1" or "0", and determines whether the 'start' and 'stop' commands should
record an annotation when being executed. The default value is "0". The text of
the corresponding annotations is controlled by:

.TP
.B journal.time.start.annotation=Started task
The text of the annotation that is recorded when executing the start command and
having set journal.time.

.TP
.B journal.time.stop.annotation=Stopped task
The text of the annotation that is recorded when executing the stop command and
having set journal.time.

.TP
.B journal.info=1
When enabled, this setting causes a change log of each task to be displayed by
the 'info' command. Default value is "1".

.SS HOLIDAYS
Holidays are entered either directly in the .taskrc file or via an include file
that is specified in .taskrc. For single-day holidays the name and the date is
required to be given:

.nf
    holiday.towel.name=Day of the towel
    holiday.towel.date=20100525
.fi

For holidays that span a range of days (i.e. vacation), you can use a start date
and an end date:

.nf
    holiday.sysadmin.name=System Administrator Appreciation Week
    holiday.sysadmin.start=20100730
    holiday.sysadmin.end=20100805
.fi

.RS
Dates are to be entered according to the setting in the dateformat.holiday
variable.
.RE

.RS
The following holidays are computed automatically: Good Friday (goodfriday),
Easter (easter), Easter Monday (eastermonday), Ascension (ascension), Pentecost
(pentecost). The date for these holidays is the given keyword:
.RE

.nf
    holiday.eastersunday.name=Easter
    holiday.eastersunday.date=easter
.fi

Note that the Taskwarrior distribution contains example holiday files that can
be included like this:

.nf
    include holidays.en-US.rc
.fi

.SS DEPENDENCIES

.TP
.B dependency.reminder=1
Determines whether dependency chain violations generate reminders.

.TP
.B dependency.confirmation=1
Determines whether dependency chain repair requires confirmation.

.SS COLOR CONTROLS

.TP
.B color=1
May be "1" or "0". Determines whether Taskwarrior uses color. When "0",
will use dashes (-----) to underline column headings.

.TP
.B fontunderline=1
Determines if font underlines or ASCII dashes should be used to underline
headers, even when color is enabled.
.RE

Taskwarrior has a number of coloration rules. They correspond to a particular
attribute of a task, such as it being due, or being active, and specifies the
automatic coloring of that task. A list of valid colors, depending on your
terminal, can be obtained by running the command:

.RS
.B task colors
.RE

.RS
Note that no default values are listed here - the defaults now correspond to the
dark-256.theme (Linux) and dark-16.theme (other) theme values.
The coloration rules are as follows:
.RE

.RS
.B color.due.today
Task is due today
.br
.B color.active
Task is started, therefore active.
.br
.B color.scheduled
Task is scheduled, therefore ready for work.
.br
.B color.until
Task has an expiration date.
.br
.B color.blocking
Task is blocking another in a dependency.
.br
.B color.blocked
Task is blocked by a dependency.
.br
.B color.overdue
Task is overdue (due some time prior to now).
.br
.B color.due
Task is coming due.
.br
.B color.project.none
Task does not have an assigned project.

To disable a coloration rule for which there is a default, set the value to
nothing, for example:
.nf
    color.tagged=
.fi

.RS
By default, colors produced by rules blend. This has the advantage of
conveying additional information, by producing combinations that are not used
by any particular rule directly.

However, color blending can produce highlighting combinations which are not
desired. In such cases, use the following option to disable this behaviour:
.RE

.TP
.B rule.color.merge=1
Can be "1" or "0". When "0", disables merging of colors produced by
different color rules. Use if your color scheme produces unpleasing

Urgency coefficient for waiting status
.RE
.B urgency.active.coefficient=4.0
.RS

.RE
.B urgency.scheduled.coefficient=5.0
.RS
Urgency coefficient for scheduled tasks
.RE
.B urgency.project.coefficient=1.0
.RS
Urgency coefficient for projects
.RE
.B urgency.tags.coefficient=1.0
.RS
Urgency coefficient for tags
.RE
.B urgency.annotations.coefficient=1.0
.RS
Urgency coefficient for annotations
.RE
.B urgency.age.coefficient=2.0
.RS
Urgency coefficient for the age of tasks
.RE
.B urgency.age.max=365
.RS
Maximum age in days. After this number of days has elapsed, the urgency of a task won't increase any more because of aging.
.RE
.B urgency.user.tag.<tag>.coefficient=...
.RS
Specific tag coefficient.
.RE
.B urgency.user.tag.next.coefficient=15.0
.RS
Urgency coefficient for tag 'next'.
.RE
.B urgency.user.project.<project>.coefficient=...
.RS
Specific project coefficient.
.RE
.B urgency.user.keyword.<keyword>.coefficient=...
.RS
Specific description keyword coefficient.
.RE
.B urgency.uda.<name>.coefficient=...
.RS
Presence/absence of UDA data.
.RE
.B urgency.uda.<name>.<value>.coefficient=...
.RS
Specific value of UDA data.
.RE

The coefficients reflect the relative importance of the various terms in the
urgency calculation. These are default values, and may be modified to suit your
preferences, but it is important that you carefully consider any modifications.

.B urgency.inherit=0
.RS
Not actually a coefficient. When enabled, blocking tasks inherit
the highest urgency value found in the tasks they block. This is
done recursively.
It is recommended to set urgency.blocking.coefficient and
urgency.blocked.coefficient to 0.0 in order for this setting to
be the most useful.

.SS DEFAULTS

.TP
.B
default.project=foo
Provides a default project name for the
.I task add
command, if you don't specify one. The default is blank.

.TP
.B
default.due=...
Provides a default due date for the
.I task add
command, if you don't specify one. You can use a date, or a duration value which
is assumed to be relative to 'now'. The default is blank.

.TP
.B
default.scheduled=...
Provides a default scheduled date for the
.I task add
command, if you don't specify one. You can use a date, or a duration value which
is assumed to be relative to 'now'. The default is blank.

.TP
.B
uda.<name>.default=...
Provides default values for UDA fields when using the
.I task add
command, if you don't specify values. The default is blank.

.TP
.B
default.command=next
Provides a default command that is run every time Taskwarrior is invoked with no
arguments. For example, if set to:

.nf
    default.command=project:foo list
.fi

.RS
then Taskwarrior will run the "project:foo list" command if no command is
specified. This means that by merely typing
.RE

.nf
    $ task
    [task project:foo list]

    ID Project Pri Description
     1 foo     H   Design foo
     2 foo         Build foo
.fi

.SS REPORTS

The reports can be customized by using the following configuration variables.
The output columns, their labels and the sort order can be set using the
corresponding variables for each report. Each report name is used as a
"command" name. For example

.TP
.B task overdue

.TP
.B report.X.description
The description for report X when running the "task help" command.

.TP
.B report.X.columns
This is a comma-separated list of columns and formatting specifiers. See the
command 'task columns' for a full list of options and examples.

.TP
.B report.X.context
A boolean value representing whether the given report should respect (apply)
the currently active context. See CONTEXT section for details about context.
Defaults to 1.

.TP
.B report.X.labels
The labels for each column that will be used when generating report X. The
labels are a comma separated list.

.TP
.B report.X.sort
The sort order of the tasks in the generated report X. The sort order is
specified by using the column ids post-fixed by a "+" for ascending sort order
or a "-" for descending sort order. The sort IDs are separated by commas.
For example:

.nf
    report.list.sort=due+,priority-,start.active-,project+
.fi

Additionally, after the "+" or "-", there can be a solidus "/" which indicates
that there are breaks after the column values change. For example:

.nf
    report.minimal.sort=project+/,description+
.fi

This sort order now specifies that there is a listing break between each
project. A listing break is simply a blank line, which provides a visual
grouping.

A special sort value of "none" indicates that no sorting is required, and tasks
will be presented in the order (if any) in which they are selected.

.TP
.B report.X.filter
This adds a filter to the report X so that only tasks matching the filter
criteria are displayed in the generated report.

There is a special case for 'report.timesheet.filter', which may be specified
even though the 'timesheet' report is not very customizable.

.TP
.B report.X.dateformat
This adds a dateformat to the report X that will be used by the "due date"
column. If it is not set then dateformat.report and dateformat will be used in
this order. See the
.B DATES
section for details on the sequence placeholders.

.TP
.B report.X.annotations
This adds the possibility to control the output of annotations for a task in a
report. Deprecated. Use the
.B description
column with a format (e.g.,
\fBdescription.count\fP)
instead.

.TP
Taskwarrior comes with a number of predefined reports, which are:

.TP
.B next
Lists the most important tasks.

.TP
.B long
Lists all pending tasks and all data, matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B list
Lists all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B ls
Short listing of all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B minimal
Minimal listing of all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B newest
Shows the newest tasks.

.TP
.B oldest
Shows the oldest tasks.

.TP
.B overdue
Lists overdue tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B active
Lists active tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B completed
Lists completed tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B recurring
Lists recurring tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B waiting
Lists all waiting tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B all
Lists all tasks matching the specified criteria.

.TP
.B blocked
Lists all tasks that have dependencies.

.SS USER DEFINED ATTRIBUTES

User defined attributes (UDAs) are an extension mechanism that allows you to
define new attributes for Taskwarrior to store and display. One such example is
an 'estimate' attribute that could be used to store time estimates associated
with a task. This 'estimate' attribute is not built in to Taskwarrior, but with
a few simple configuration settings you can instruct Taskwarrior to store this
item, and provide access to it for custom reports and filters.

This allows you to augment Taskwarrior to accommodate your workflow, or bend the
rules and use Taskwarrior to store and synch data that is not necessarily
task-related.

One important restriction is that because this is an open system that allows
the definition of any new attribute, Taskwarrior cannot understand the meaning
of that attribute. So while Taskwarrior will faithfully store, modify, report,
sort and filter your UDA, it does not understand anything about it. For example
if you define a UDA named 'estimate', Taskwarrior will not know that this value
is weeks, hours, minutes, money, or some other resource count.

.TP
.B uda.<name>.type=string|numeric|date|duration
.RS
Defines a UDA called '<name>', of the specified type.
.RE

.TP
.B uda.<name>.label=<column heading>
.RS
Provides a default report label for the UDA called '<name>'.
.RE

.TP
.B uda.<name>.values=A,B,C
.RS
For type 'string' UDAs only, this provides a comma-separated list of acceptable
values. In this example, the '<name>' UDA may only contain values 'A', 'B',
or 'C', but may also contain no value.

Note that the order of the value is important, and denotes the sort order from
highest ('A') to lowest ('C').

Note that a blank value is permitted.
.RE

.TP
.B uda.<name>.default=...
.RS
Provides a default value for the UDA called '<name>'.
.RE

.TP
.B Example 'estimate' UDA
This example shows an 'estimate' UDA that stores specific values for the size
of a task.  Note the blank value after 'trivial'.

.RS
.B uda.estimate.type=string
.br
.B uda.estimate.label=Size Estimate
.br
.B uda.estimate.values=huge,large,medium,small,trivial,
.RE

.RS
Note that the value are sorted

    huge > large > medium > small > trivial > ''
.RE

.SS CONTEXT
Context setting is a mechanism which allows the user to set a permanent filter,
thus avoiding the need to specify one filter repeatedly. More details on usage
can be found in the task(1) man page.

The current context is stored in the .taskrc file, along with definitions for
all user provided contexts.

.TP
.B context=<name>
.RS
Stores the value of the currently active context.
.RE

.TP
.B context.<name>.read=<filter>
.RE
.br
.B context.<name>.write=<modifications>
.RS
Stores the definition of the read or write context with the name <name>. Read
context is the default filter applied when the context is active. The write
context are the default modifications applied to newly added tasks when the
context is active.
.RE

.TP
.B context.<name>.rc.<key>=<value>
.RS
The rc type allows to override any configuration parameter for the current
context, e.g. if the default command for the context home should be changed to
home_report, the following statement could be added:

context.home.rc.default.command=home_report
.RE


.SS SYNC

These configuration settings are used to connect and sync tasks with the task
server.

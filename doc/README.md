# Documentation

This directory contains Taskwarrior documentation that is built and installed along with the executable:

* [`man`](man/) contains the source for the Taskwarrior manual pages.
* [`rc`](rc/) contains rcfiles that will be installed in `/usr/share/doc/task/rc` or equivalent.
* [`ref`](ref/) contains reference documentation that will be installed in `/usr/share/doc/task` or equivalent.

It also contains [developer documentation](devel/README.md) with a high-level view of how Taskwarrior development is done and how the pieces of the system fit together.

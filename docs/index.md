## RFC's

This is where design documents (RFCs) are kept.

Although these documents are less formal than [IETF RFCs](https://www.ietf.org/rfc) they serve a similar purpose.
These documents apply only to the Taskwarrior family of products, and are placed here to invite comment before designs finalize.

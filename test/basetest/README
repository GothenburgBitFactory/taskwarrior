Shell environment variables that affect how and what tests are executed:

TASKW_SKIP -> Causes any test that needs Taskwarrior (task binary) to be skipped
TASKD_SKIP -> Causes any test that needs Task Server (taskd binary) to be skipped
TASK_USE_PATH -> Causes tests to look for "task" in PATH instead of the default location
TASKD_USE_PATH -> Causes tests to look for "taskd" in PATH instead of the default location

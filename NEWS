New Configuration Options in Taskwarrior 2.6.0

  - The 'default.scheduled' date/duration works just like 'default.due'.
  - The 'report.timesheet.filter' setting controls the tasks shown by the
    'timesheet' command.

Newly Deprecated Features in Taskwarrior 2.6.0

  - The 'DUETODAY' virtual tag is a synonym for the 'TODAY' virtual tag, and is
    not needed.
  - The 'new-uuid' verbosity option is to be removed, as it is redundant, its
    functionality will be merged with 'new-id' option.
  - The use of alternate Boolean configuration settings is deprecated. Use values
    "0" for off, and "1" for on.  Avoid used of "on", "off", "true", "t",
    "false", "f", "yes", "y", "no", "n".
  - The 'PARENT' and 'CHILD' virtual tags are replaced by 'TEMPLATE' and 'INSTANCE'.

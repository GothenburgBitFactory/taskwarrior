New Features in Taskwarrior 2.6.0

  - The logic behind new-uuid verbosity option changed. New-uuid now overrides
    new-id if set and will cause Taskwarrior to display UUIDs instead of IDs
    for new tasks (machine friendly).
  - If ~/.taskrc is not found, Taskwarrior will look for its configuration in
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc (defaulting to ~/.config/task/taskrc). This
    allows users to setup their Taskwarrior to follow XDG standard without
    using config overrides.
  - Newer Unicode characters, such as emojis are correctly handled and displayed.
    Taskwarrior now supports all Unicode characters up to Unicode 11.
  - Datetime values until year 9999 are now supported.
    Duration values of up to 1 000 000 years are now supported.
  - 64-bit numeric values (up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) are now supported.
  - Later/someday named datetime values now resolve to 9999-12-30 (instead of
    2038-01-18).

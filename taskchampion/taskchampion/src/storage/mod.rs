/**
This module defines the backend storage used by [`Replica`](crate::Replica).
It defines a [trait](crate::storage::Storage) for storage implementations, and provides a default on-disk implementation as well as an in-memory implementation for testing.

Typical uses of this crate do not interact directly with this module; [`StorageConfig`](crate::StorageConfig) is sufficient.
However, users who wish to implement their own storage backends can implement the traits defined here and pass the result to [`Replica`](crate::Replica).

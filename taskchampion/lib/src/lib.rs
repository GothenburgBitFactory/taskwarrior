/// TaskChampion
///
/// This file defines the C interface to libtaskchampion.  This is a thin wrapper around the Rust
/// `taskchampion` crate.  Refer to the documentation for that crate at
/// https://docs.rs/taskchampion/latest/taskchampion/ for API details.  The comments in this file
/// focus mostly on the low-level details of passing values to and from TaskChampion.
///
/// # Overview
///
/// This library defines four major types used to interact with the API, that map directly to Rust
/// types.
///
///  * TCReplica - see https://docs.rs/taskchampion/latest/taskchampion/struct.Replica.html
///  * TCTask - see https://docs.rs/taskchampion/latest/taskchampion/struct.Task.html
///  * TCServer - see https://docs.rs/taskchampion/latest/taskchampion/trait.Server.html
///  * TCWorkingSet - see https://docs.rs/taskchampion/latest/taskchampion/struct.WorkingSet.html
///
/// It also defines a few utility types:
///
///  * TCString - a wrapper around both C (NUL-terminated) and Rust (always utf-8) strings.
///  * TC…List - a list of objects represented as a C array
///  * see below for the remainder
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Each type contains specific instructions to ensure memory safety.  The general rules are as
/// follows.
///
/// No types in this library are threadsafe.  All values should be used in only one thread for their
/// entire lifetime.  It is safe to use unrelated values in different threads (for example,
/// different threads may use different TCReplica values concurrently).
///
/// ## Pass by Pointer
///
/// Several types such as TCReplica and TCString are "opaque" types and always handled as pointers
/// in C. The bytes these pointers address are private to the Rust implemetation and must not be
/// accessed from C.
///
/// Pass-by-pointer values have exactly one owner, and that owner is responsible for freeing the
/// value (using a `tc_…_free` function), or transferring ownership elsewhere.  Except where
/// documented otherwise, when a value is passed to C, ownership passes to C as well.  When a value
/// is passed to Rust, ownership stays with the C code.  The exception is TCString, ownership of
/// which passes to Rust when it is used as a function argument.
///
/// The limited circumstances where one value must not outlive another, due to pointer references
/// between them, are documented below.
///
/// ## Pass by Value
///
/// Types such as TCUuid and TC…List are passed by value, and contain fields that are accessible
/// from C.  C code is free to access the content of these types in a _read_only_ fashion.
///
/// Pass-by-value values that contain pointers also have exactly one owner, responsible for freeing
/// the value or transferring ownership.  The tc_…_free functions for these types will replace the
/// pointers with NULL to guard against use-after-free errors.  The interior pointers in such values
/// should never be freed directly (for example, `tc_string_free(tcuda.value)` is an error).
///
/// TCUuid is a special case, because it does not contain pointers.  It can be freely copied and
/// need not be freed.
///
/// ## Lists
///
/// Lists are a special kind of pass-by-value type.  Each contains `len` and `items`, where `items`
/// is an array of length `len`.  Lists, and the values in the `items` array, must be treated as
/// read-only.  On return from an API function, a list's ownership is with the C caller, which must
/// eventually free the list.  List data must be freed with the `tc_…_list_free` function.  It is an
/// error to free any value in the `items` array of a list.
